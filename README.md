Private DNS Ad-Blocking and Remote Access with Pi-hole + Unbound + Tailscale

üëã Why I Built This
I care about online privacy and wanted to block ads and trackers across all my devices, not just in browsers. Public DNS providers like Google or Cloudflare are fast, but often log user data. I wanted full control over DNS resolution and to keep it private.

My internet provider (Jio Fiber) uses CGNAT, so I don‚Äôt get a public IP address. That makes remote access tricky. This project uses Tailscale to solve that problem while offering secure DNS resolution and ad-blocking.

üîç Problems Solved

Block ads and trackers across all devices
Encrypt and control DNS traffic (no third-party logging)
Secure, recursive DNS resolution via Unbound
Enable remote DNS and Pi-hole admin access even behind CGNAT
Learn real-world Linux, Docker, VPN, DNS, and firewall management

üß∞ Tools Used

macOS (host)
Colima to run Docker with Lima backend on macOS
Docker for containerization
Pi-hole (ad-blocking DNS)
Unbound (recursive DNS resolver)
Tailscale (zero-config WireGuard-based VPN)

üõ†Ô∏è How I Built It

1. Setup Docker + Colima

Install Colima and start it:

brew install colima

colima start --memory 2 --cpu 2 --disk 15

Ensure Docker is pointed to Colima:

export DOCKER_HOST=unix://$HOME/.colima/default/docker.sock

2. Create Docker Compose Setup

Created docker-compose.yml with services:

Unbound listening on port 5335

Pi-hole using Unbound as upstream DNS

Created necessary folders:

mkdir -p unbound pihole/etc-pihole pihole/etc-dnsmasq.d

2.1 Prepare Unbound Files

Unbound requires a root server list and DNSSEC trust anchor.

Download them:

# Root DNS server list

curl -o ./unbound/root.hints https://www.internic.net/domain/named.cache

# Root DNSSEC trust key


curl -o ./unbound/root.key https://data.iana.org/root-anchors/root.key

Make sure your unbound.conf file is also in the unbound/ directory and properly configured.

3. Generate Tailscale Auth Key
Went to Tailscale admin panel
Created an ACL tag (e.g. tag:pihole)
Generated an auth key tagged with tag:pihole
Used that auth key in Docker Compose for Tailscale container

4. Set ACL Tag Permissions

"tagOwners": {
  "tag:pihole": ["user:your_email@example.com"]
},
"acls": [
  {
    "action": "accept",
    "src": ["tag:pihole"],
    "dst": ["*:*"]
  }
]
5. Start Services

docker compose up -d

Tailscale container auto-joined the network, and Pi-hole was accessible locally.

5.1 (Optional) Test Unbound Resolution
Ensure Unbound is resolving domains before Pi-hole starts using it:

dig @127.0.0.1 -p 5335 google.com

6. Add Tailscale Global DNS
Opened Tailscale DNS settings
Added Pi-hole container‚Äôs Tailscale IP as a global nameserver (port 53)
Disabled MagicDNS

7. Remote Access

Tested DNS queries from remote Tailscale-connected devices:

nslookup google.com 100.x.x.x

Expected output:

Name:    google.com  
Address: 142.251.221.110

ü§Ø What I Learned
Difference between recursive and forwarded DNS
Tailscale ACLs and DNS overrides
Docker networking and port mappings
Unbound configuration for Pi-hole
Colima/Lima integration for macOS-based Docker usage

üöÄ Future Plans
Add DNS-over-HTTPS fallback
Use Raspberry Pi or always-on NUC
Integrate 2FA for Pi-hole admin
Add logging and monitoring for DNS performance
